	abstract="During the last five years a peak of interest has been observed in the problems related to computer-aided timetabling. The most recent works in this area are based on the application of modern information technologies. Here the main directions of modern research and design are reviewed. A classification is proposed for academic timetabling problems, requirements for the timetables, mathematical models, solution methods, data representation, and interface design. Modern problem solution and software design approaches are represented in connection with the theoretical background and world experience of 35 years. The integration of several algorithmic and interactive tools is discussed. Criticisms of timetabling computer support practicability and related myths are also reviewed. Related topics, like sport scheduling and scheduling sport, are represented. Some unsolved matters are outlined.",

	abstract = {Educational timetabling is an ongoing challenging administrative task that is required in most academic institutions. This is mainly due to a large number of constraints and requirements that have to be satisfied. Educational timetabling problems have been classified as NP-hard problems and can be divided into three types: exam timetabling, course timetabling and high school timetabling. The domain of high school timetabling is not well developed when compared to other fields of educational timetabling such as university exam timetabling and course timetabling. As the evolution of the educational systems are continuous, new challenges often arise, requiring new models and solution methodologies. Over the years, a number of methodologies have been developed to address high school timetabling problems. However, there are no comparative studies or rigorous analysis of these methodologies. This survey paper aims to provide a scientific review of high school timetabling. The paper presents a categorisation of the methodologies conducted in recent years based on chronology, category and application (dataset). We first present comparative studies on the success of proposed methodologies. The components and mechanisms of different methodologies are analysed and compared. We also discuss their performance, advantages, disadvantages and potential for improvement. Methodology wise, a shift of popularity from meta-heuristic to mathematical optimisation is observed in recent years. Another observation is that more researchers are opting for XHSTT formatted datasets as a testbed for their algorithms. Finally, we outline the industrial perspective, trends and future direction in high school timetabling optimisation problems.}

	abstract = {The High School Timetabling Problem requires the assignment of times and resources to events, while sets of required and desirable constraints must be considered. The most common approach for this problem is to employ metaheuristic methods. This work presents a matheuristic approach that combines a Variable Neighbourhood Search algorithm with mathematical programming-based neighbourhoods for high school timetabling. Computational experiments on well-known benchmark instances demonstrate the success of the proposed hybrid approach, which outperforms the standalone Variable Neighbourhood Search algorithm by far. Additionally, the proposed algorithm was able to improve 15 out of 17 current best known solutions in a very famous benchmark set.}

The timetabling problem involves scheduling a number of tuples, each consisting of class of students, a teacher, a subject and a room, to a fixed number of time slots. A Monte Carlo scheme called simulated annealing is used as an optimisation technique. The paper introduces the timetabling problem, and then describes the simulated annealing method. Annealing is then applied to the timetabling problem. A prototype timetabling environment is described followed by some experimental results. A parallel algorithm which can be implemented on a multiprocessor is presented. This algorithm can provide a faster solution than the equivalent sequential algorithm. Some further experimental results are given.},
